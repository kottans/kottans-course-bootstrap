## Souvenirs

In case team and pupils are doing well and want to commemorate the course ending you may try to make some creative stuff e.g. printed T-Shirs or Hoodies, or both.

### Nessessary team roles:

- **Person who cares** *(required)* and handles all negotiation with company that makes stuff and also collects money. Must have decent amount of reliability.
- **Designer**  *(optional)* to make basic check of created design.
- **Authority representative** *(optional)* a member of Kottans who has enough authority to handle conflict situations and provide pledge for some members(e.g. for kottans in other cities)

Of course, these roles can be handled by one person, but availibility of such people can drastically simplify all process

### Creating stuff design

Details/sources about souvenirs from previous courses can be found **[here](https://github.com/Kottans/artifacts)**


### Gathering orders > Collecting money > Handout

Use **[Google Forms](https://docs.google.com/forms/)**  with spreadsheet to collect info about
- amount of items
- size
- model (female\male)
- city
- *etc.*

> - allow multiple responses
> - allow anonymous responses
> - allow people to change their responses

Further, you'll use linked spreadsheet in next ways:
- to summarize amount and sizes of stuff
- to summarize total costs and check state of money collecting  
- to control stuff handout

**Be sure you communicate all nessessary info to community. People must know what is current project status.
Lack of communication is bad.**

You ~~may~~ will annoy them, so try to entertain and keep their heads up. =)

Don't be afraid to say 'no' to people who totally missed the party of orders collecting.    

### Negotiations with agency

Kottan members in Kyiv had successful experience of collaborating with this agency:
[http://masterskayafutbolok.com/](http://masterskayafutbolok.com/)

Order parameters:
- print type	flex
>updates about quality of printing may be here.

- front size	A4 (A3 image will fold and be partially visible)
- back size	A3
- T-shirt brand **"Fruit of the Loom"**
- Hoodie brand **"Sol's"**
- color quantity ~6 ( less is better,  more is longer and may cost more)

In order to minimize impact of misunderstanding:
- Be sure you've done your best to create *.ai* file with vector image to print. **Designer** here would be most helpful. Example is **[here](https://github.com/Kottans/artifacts/blob/master/wear_sources/js-course-shirt/js2016-3/kottan-JS-3-final.ai)**
- Try to get samples of different sizes\colors and show those to community. Thus, you'll remove size and quality questions that may occur within community.
- Get double confirmation about complexity of your design from agency that will implement it. Sometimes they may be wrong in their estimates. Be ready for that.

### Delivery

Within one city plan some meetings e.g. **BeerJS** and give people what they payed for.

When dealing with several cities find responsible one for that particular city and send package via any familiar delivery service.
